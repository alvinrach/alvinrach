After a while, I started to feel that I need to choose my preferred Data Science domain. I've decided, here it is:
-Stock market related domain: time series forecasting, anomaly detection, reinforcement learning, etc
-Banking related domain: risk modelling, fraud detection, customer segmentation, customer lifetime values, etc
-Online shop related domain: recommendation system, etc
